Attune provides a solution to streamline the OS installation process.

This Attune Project sets up a Windows machine as a worker for automating 
operating system installations.

# What is a worker?

The majority of the workload creating the ISO file(s) 
is performed on either the Attune host machine or a separate machine. This 
machine is referred to as the worker.

The workload covers tasks such as unpacking ISO, repackaging with the drivers 
and configurations, deploying files to the controller, and triggering APIs on 
the controller.
