Create a shared space for storing and accessing files.

SMB (Server Message Block) is widely supported and provides a flexible way 
to connect different devices and operating systems for file sharing.

This process includes:
* Enable the File and Printer Sharing service, 
* configure the firewall for Network Discovery, 
* create an SMB share folder, 
* setup appropriate NTFS permissions, and 
* Turn off password protected sharing (optional).
